# CS50 Nuggets
## Implementation Spec
### windows_us, Winter 2022

According to the [Requirements Spec](REQUIREMENTS.md), the Nuggets game requires two standalone programs: a client and a server.
Our design also includes the player and grid modules.
We describe each program and module separately.
We do not describe the `support` library nor the modules that enable features that go beyond the spec.
We avoid repeating information that is provided in the requirements spec.

## Plan for division of labor

Ethan: Client, Client Testing, nCurses.

Miles: Grid, Grid Testing, Server/Client Communication, overall module integration.

Matthew: Player movement (serverside).

Karsten: Vision and vision testing, Player.

All: Server (split by function), Server Testing, Documentation.

## Client

### Data structures

Client and Server will use the `struct player`, as defined below. 
Server will make use of the `struct player`, as defined below.

### Definition of function prototypes

```c
static int parseArgs(const int argc, char* argv[]);
```
Parses arguments to make sure they are valid. Decide if client is player or spectator. 


```c
static bool handleInput(void* arg);
```
Reads lines from stdin and sends them to server if valid. Returns true if message loop should end. 

```c
static bool checkInput(void* arg);
```
Checks input to ensure it is valid. Returns true if yes, false if no. Helper to handleInput. 

```c
static void initialGrid(const char* gridInfo);
```
Deals with initial GRID message (checks size of display). 

```c
static void renderScreen(const char* mapString, player_t* player);
```
Renders the map. 

```c
static void joinGame(void* arg, player_t* player);
```
Sends message containing player's 'real name' (taken from the command line) and initializes player. If there was no player name passed in from the command line (so the client is a spectator) send the `SPECTATOR` message.

```c
static void leaveGame(const char* message, player_t* player);
```
Prints disconnect message from server and frees all data structures. 

```c
static void updatePlayer(const char* message, const char* first, player_t* player);
```
Updates player struct as new information (GOLD, OK, DISPLAY) comes in. 


### Detailed pseudo code


#### `parseArgs`:

	validate commandline
	initialize message module
	print assigned port number
	decide whether spectator or player
    initialize player
    
#### `handleMessage`:
    
    read first word into first string
    read everything after first word into message string
    if first is GRID
        pass message to initialGrid
        call joinGame
    if first is GOLD or DISPLAY or OK
        pass message, first, player to updatePlayer
    if first is QUIT
        pass message, player to leaveGame

#### `handleInput`:

    checkInput
    allocate buffer
    read input into buffer
        strip newline
    send message to server in 'KEY [key]' format as in requirements

#### `checkInput`:

    check that arg is not null
    check that server exists
    read input
    check that input is a valid command (keystroke)
        if spectator, q is only valid keystroke

#### `initialGrid`:

    read string into two integers, row num and column num
    check that display fits grid
    
#### `renderScreen`:

    print "header string" with information described in requirements spec
    print local map string (stored in player) to console 
    
#### `joinGame`:

    initialize player struct
    store name from command line in player struct if it is valid (non-space characters)
      build string "PLAY [real name]"
      send string to server
      free string
    if there was no playername provided at command line start
      send SPECTATE to server
    
#### `updatePlayer`:


    if GOLD message
        read string into variables
        update player gold
        print all gold info
    if DISPLAY message
        update player display
        call renderScreen with map string
    if OK message
        update player letter

#### `leaveGame`:

    print quit message from server 
    delete player struct
    free everything else

## Server

### Data structures

We use a hashtable to store player structs (defined in the player module) for the current players in the game, the key refers to a player's letter name and the item is a player struct.

We use a grid struct, defined in the grid module, to represent the game map.

We use a player struct to represent and store data pertaining to each player connected to the server.

### Definition of function prototypes

A function to parse the command-line arguments, initialize the game struct, initialize the message module, and (BEYOND SPEC) initialize analytics module.

```c
static int parseArgs(const int argc, char* argv[]);
```

A function which utilizes the grid module to create a map, generates a random number (between 10 and 30) of piles each with a random number of gold (total of 250) populate the map with gold piles. 

```c
static int initializeGame(char* filepathname, int seed);
```

Initializes a new player setting their gold to 0 and placing them randomly on the map, connects player with server

```c
static void handlePlayerConnect(char* playerName, addr_t from);
```

Handles player disconnects, if a player disconnects early, print QUIT message and remove player. If game is over, disconnects all players and sends end of game message

```c
static void handlePlayerQuit(player_t* player);
```

Updates all players to a statechange, calculating new visibility and updating their maps

```c
static void updateClientState(char* map);
```

Creates a new spectator if one does not exists, otherwise sends QUIT message to current spectator and creates a new spectator

```c
static void handleSpectator(addr_t from);
```

Send each client a GAMEOVER message, including results from the game, disconnect each client from the game.

```c
static void gameOver(bool normalExit);
```

Handles a player move, validating move and updating map

```c
static void movePlayer(player_t* player, char directionChar);
```

Updates vision for all players in the game.

```c
static void updatePlayersVision();
```

Converts a given string of of all numbers to an integer, returns true if successful, false otherwise
```c=
static bool strToInt(const char string[], int* number);
```

Randomly generates piles of gold and adds them to the map, returns the number of piles generated
```c=
static int generateGold(grid_t* grid, int* piles, int* seed);
```

Sends approriate messages to all players for use in gameOver, passed to hashtable_iterate
```c=
static void gameOverHelper(void* arg, const char* key, void* item);
```

Handles event when a client picks up gold. Passed a player, returns true if last pile is picked up, otherwise false. A true result indicates the game should end.
```c=
static bool pickupGold(player_t* player);
```

Sends the GOLD message to a client saying they picked up gold, for use in pickupDolg, possed to hashtable_iterate 

```c=
static void pickupGoldHelper(void* arg, const char* key, void* item);

```

Updates the players about the game state whenever a player picks up gold.

```c=
static void moveIterateHelper(void* arg, const char* key, void* item);
```

Used in movePlayer in order to find a player with a given characterID.

```c=
static void repeatMovePlayerHelper(player_t* player, int directionValue);
```

Used in movePlayer to repeatedly move a given player in the direction of a given integer value.

```c=
static void movePlayerHelper(player_t* player, int directionValue);
```

Used in movePlayer to move a given player in the direction of a given integer value once.

```c=
static void updateHelper(void*arg, const char* key, void* item);
```

Updates the vision and sends display messages for each player in the game.

```c=
static void sendGrid(addr_t to);
```

Sends the grid message to a given address.

```c=
static void sendGold(player_t* player, int goldCollected);
```

Abstracts the process of sending the gold message to a client.

```c=
static void sendOk(player_t* player);
```

Abstracts the process of sending the ok message to a client.

```c=
static void sendDisplay(player_t* player, char* displayString);
```

Sends the client the string that it needs to render.

```c
static bool handleMessage(void* arg, const addr_t from, const char* message);
```
Framework for receiving messages; calls appropriate function based on message received. Returns true on fatal error. 

```c=
static bool handleKey(char key, addr_t from);
```

Handles key input from the client and calls appropriate function based on the input.

## Grid 

The *grid* module implements the map used by the nuggets game and encapsulates all functions that create, delete, or modify the in-game map.

### Data structures

The primary data structure within the `grid` module is the `struct grid`. It stores both the reference and active mapDeclaration:

```c
typedef struct grid {
  char* reference;
  char* active;
  size_t mapLen;
  int numColumns;
  int numRows;
  char* mapFile;
} grid_t;

```

### Definition of function prototypes

#### Getters
Getters are fairly self-explanatory, returning the relevant values or `NULL`/ 0 if they don't exist. 
```c
char* grid_getReference(grid_t* grid);
char* grid_getMapFile(grid_t* grid);
char* grid_getActive(grid_t* grid);
int grid_getNumRows(grid_t* grid);
int grid_getNumColumns(grid_t* grid);
size_t grid_getMapLen(grid_t* grid);
```

#### `grid_new`
The grid_new function creates a `struct grid` that contains information about the in-game map. It is built by reading the file at the path provided.
```c
grid_t* grid_new(char* mapFile);
```

#### `grid_replace`
The grid_replace function provides the ability to replace the character at the given index position in the given grid's active map with the given character. It is primarily used as a helper for other functions, but is still exported for its general functionality.

```c
bool grid_replace(grid_t* grid, int pos, char newChar);
```

#### `grid_delete`
The grid_delete function free's all memory in use by the provided grid. It can be called on a grid where the inner strings are `NULL`, as it checks before free'ing those strings.

```c
void grid_delete(grid_t* grid);
```

#### `longestRowLength`
The longestRowLength function finds the length of the longest row in a map, which corresponds to the number of columns in the map. It is a helper function for grid_new.

```c
static int longestRowLength(char* map);
```

#### `posToCoordinates`
Converts a position integer into cartesian coordinates in the form of a int array

```c=
static void posToCoordinates(grid_t* grid, int pos, int* tuple);
```

#### `coordinatesToPos`
Converts cartesian coordinates to a position within the map string.

```c=
static int coordinatesToPos(grid_t* grid, int x, int y);
```

#### `grid_containsEmptyTile`
Returns a boolean true if there is an empty room tile within the map, false otherwise.
```c=
bool grid_containsEmptyTile
```

#### `grid_revertTile`
Takes a grid and position int as arguments, reverts the tile back to its reference map values.
```c=
bool grid_revertTile(grid_t* grid, int pos);
```

#### `grid_calculateVision`
Given a grid, position, and vision array and calculates a player's current vision based on the position, modifies the given integer array, populating it with 1
```c=
void grid_calculateVision(grid_t* grid, int pos, int* vision);
```


### Detailed pseudo code

Getters are fairly self-explanatory and will not be detailed here, see the appropriate README for details.

#### `grid_new`:
```
allocate space for the grid struct
open map file
if it opens successfully
  find number of rows using file_numLines
  read reference map into memory using file_readFile
  create active map as a copy of reference
  set number of columns using findLongestRow()
  return the grid
delete grid and return NULL in case of failure to open file or allocate memory 

```

#### `grid_replace`:
```
if either string in parameters are NULL or if given index is less than 0
  return false
set the character at the given position in the given grid's active map to the given character
return true
```

#### `grid_delete`:
```
if the active map is not null
  free it
if the reference map is not null
  free it
free the given grid
```


#### `longestRowLength`:
```
store the length of the given map
loop over all characters in the map
  if the current character is '\n'
    if the length of the current row is greater than previous max
      set max to current length
    reset current length 
  else
    increment current length
return max length
```

#### `posToCoordinates`:
```
store x as the pos mod row length
store y as the pos / row length
input values into the int array
return
```

#### `coordinatesToPos`
```
pos = y * row length + x
return pos
```

#### `grid_containsEmptyTile`
```
iterate through map
  if room tile found:
    return true
    
return false
```

#### `grid_revertTile`
```
check parametes
change grid active position to reference grid value
```

#### `grid_calculateVision`
```
given a grid, position and int array
starting at the given position:
check cardinal directions (up, down, left, right)
  walk in a direction until you hit the edge of the map
    if a wall has not been found mark position as visible
    if the current tile is a wall, mark wall as being found
    otherwise the current tile is not visible
    
iterate through all points in the map
  mark wall as not seen
  if the point has not yet been visited
    calculate slope between position and point
    decide whether the slope squared is <= 1
    if slope <= 1 walk along on the x axis, otherwise walk along the y axis
    if position < point walk:
      walk in the positive direction
    else:
      walk in the negative direction
  
  walk from the position to the point along the approprate axis
    if the dependent variable intersects exactly at a point:
      if a wall hasn't been seen, mark the point as visible
      if the point is a wall, note a wall has been found
      if wall has previously been found mark point as not visible
    if the dependent variable intersects between two points:
      select the point which the dependent variable is closer to
      if a wall has not been seen mark both points as visible
      if the closer point is a wall, mark wall as found
      if wall has previously been found mark point as not visible
```

## Player

The *player* module defines and implements the `struct player` that encapsulates all of the information required for each player, including their name, a `struct grid` containing the player's map, which is the sum of their current and previous vision, current position, and current gold. 

### Data structures
The primary data structure within the *player* module is the `struct player`, which is then used by both the `client` and the `server`. It is defined as follows:
```c
typedef struct player {
  char* name;
  grid_t* vision;
  addr_t address;
  char charID;
  int pos;
  int gold;
} player_t
```

### Definition of function prototypes
#### Getters
Getters are fairly self-explanatory, returning the relevant values or `NULL`/ 0 if they don't exist. 
```c
grid_t* player_getVision(player_t* player);
char* player_getName(player_t* player);
char* player_getLetter(player_t* player);
int player_getPos(player_t* player);
int player_getGold(player_t* player);
char player_getCharID(player_t* player);
addr_t player_getAddr(player_t* player);
```

#### Setters
Setters are fairly self-explanatory, providing the ability to set member values without directly referencing them. Stylistic choice to make code more readable.
```c
grid_t* player_setVision(player_t* player, grid_t* vision);
int player_setPos(player_t* player, int pos);
int player_setGold(player_t* player, int gold);
addr_t player_setAddr(player_t* player, addr_t address);
char player_setCharID(player_t* player, char newChar);
```
#### `player_new`
The *player_new* function creates a new `struct player` with the given name, position, and vision. The name and vision strings are copied by the `player` so the original strings can be free'd by the user after function call. Gold is initialized to 0.
```c
player_t* player_new(char* name);
```

#### `player_delete`
The *player_delete* function frees all the memory in use by a `struct player`. It free's the name and vision strings if they are not `NULL`, and always free's the struct itself.
```c
void player_delete(player_t* player);
```

#### `player_addGold`
Takes a player and int newGold as parameters, adds newGold to a player's existing gold total
```c=
int player_addGold(player_t* player, int newGold);
```

#### `player_summarize`
Returns a string summarizing important information about a player, specifically a player's charID, name, and gold in purse
```c=
char* player_summarize(player_t* player);
```

#### `player_updateVision`
Given a player and grid calculates a player's vision at their current position and updates their vision grid->active map to reflect what they can currently see and resets previous vision to reference map values
```c=
void player_updateVision(player_t* player, grid_t* grid)
```

### Detailed pseudo code

#### `player_new`
```
if name parameter not null
  allocate space for a new player struct
  set its name to the given string
  set gold to 0
  return the struct
else
  return NULL
```

#### `player_delete`
```
if player not null
  if vision not null
    free vision
  if name not null
    free name
free player
else
  do nothing
```

#### `player_addGold`
```
check parameters
grab player gold 
add new gold to it 
return new player gold amount
```

#### `player_summarize`
```
check parameter
malloc string of correct length
copy charID, purse, and name into string
return string
```

#### `player_updateVision`
```
check parameters
initialize vision to correct length
populate vision with zeros 
call grid_calculateVision on the vision array
grab player vision grid_t
grab global active map string and player active map string
iterate through map length
  if a players active map is not blank at this index:
    revert tile value back to reference map value
  if vision array has value 1 (visible) at this index:
    replace player active value with corresponding char from global active map
```

## Game
The *game* module defines and implements the `struct game` that stores all information about the current state of a game. 

### Data structures
The primary data structure within the *game* module is the `struct game`, which is then used by both the `server`. It is defined as follows:
```c
typedef struct game {
    int* piles;          
    hashtable_t* players; 
    int remainingGold;  
    int numPiles;       
    grid_t* grid;        
    int lastCharID;      
    int numPlayers;      
    char* mapfile;        
} game_t;
```

Getters are fairly self-explanatory, returning the relevant values or `NULL`/ 0 if they don't exist. 
```c
grid_t* game_getGrid(game_t* game);
char* game_getMapfile(game_t* game);
int* game_getPiles(game_t* game);
int game_getNumPiles(game_t* game);
hashtable_t* game_getPlayers(game_t* game);
int game_getNumPlayers(game_t* game);
int game_getRemainingGold(game_t* game);
int game_getLastCharID(game_t* game);
player_t* game_getPlayer(game_t* game, char* playerName);
```
#### Setters
Setters are fairly self-explanatory, providing the ability to set member values without directly referencing them. Stylistic choice to make code more readable.
```c
bool game_setRemainingGold(game_t* game, int gold);
int game_setNumPiles(game_t* game, int numPiles);
bool game_setGrid(game_t* game, grid_t* grid);
int game_setLastCharID(game_t* game, int charID);
int game_setNumPlayers(game_t* game, int numPlayers);

#### `game_new`
The *game_new* function allocates space for a new 'struct game'. It only malloc's space for itself. All other memory must be allocated before
A `game` takes non-null `grids` as parameters so grid_new must be called on a grid before passing it to `game`. All memory allocated by the game, its grid, and its int array are freed in game_delete.
```c
game_t* game_new(int* piles, grid_t* grid);
```

#### `game_addPlayer`
The *game_addPlayer* adds a struct player to the hashtable of players within a given game struct. The player is keyed by their name, which is copied into the hashtable's memory. Thus, in the game module's memory. All "players" are free'd with game_delete. The function returns false if invalid params or if failure to add player true on success.
```c
bool game_addPlayer(game_t* game, player_t* player);
```

#### `game_buildSummary`
The *game_buildSummary* builds the summary table displayed to players when the game ends normally. Also includes the corresponding QUIT message. Returns a malloc'd string, caller is responsible for free'ing it. Returns NULL if malloc failure or game does not exist.
```c
char* game_buildSummary(game_t* game); 
```

#### `game_getPlayer`
The *game_getPlayer* returns a pointer to the player struct corresponding to the given name. Returns NULL if given string or game invalid, or if player not in hashtable.
```c
player_t* game_getPlayer(game_t* game, char* playerName);
```

#### `game_subtractGold`
The *game_subtractGold* reduces a game's remaining gold by the given amount. It returns -1 if game does not exist. It returns the new value of game->remainingGold on success.
```c
int game_subtractGold(game_t* game, int gold);
```

#### `game_delete`
The *game_delete* free's all memory assosciated with a `game`. It sets the int array of gold piles to NULL, calls hashtable_delete on the table of players, calls grid_delete on the grid, and then free's the game itself.
```c
void game_delete(game_t* game);
```

### Detailed pseudo code

#### `game_new`
```
    initialize hashtable
    allocate memory for game struct
    initialize attributes of game struct
```

#### `game_addPlayer`
```
    validate parameters
    get playername and add to hashtable
    return true if success
    return false if fail

```

#### `game_buildSummary`
```
    validate parameters
    build summary by line
    iterate over player hashtable to print out information
    return gameSummary
```

#### `game_subtractGold`
```
    validate game
    subtract from game's remainingGold
    return game
```

#### `game_delete`
```
    validate game
    free piles of gold
    iterate over hashtable to delete players
    delete grid
    free game struct
```
## Testing plan

### unit testing

The grid module contains a small unit test that is enabled by compiling it with the GRIDTEST flag. It reads a grid into memory from a given file, prints the intial states of both reference and active maps, then modifies the active map and reprints. The grid module was tested on a variety of map files during development.

The player module is small enough that it does not require a seperate unit test. Its functionality can be determined during our larger integration and systems tests. 

### integration testing

We will test the server using the provided miniclient to test the messages we send to the server, simply echoing them back to the client's console. 

Then, we tested the server with the professor's provided client, named `profclient` in our repository. This was to ensure correct server behavior before attempting system testing. 

Once we have a server that works we will test our client by connecting to our server and observing its behavior, testing whether it can send and receive messages. 

Furthermore, we tested our client with the professor's provided server, which was never copied into this directory. It can be found in the `~/cs50-dev/shared` folder

### system testing

First, we will test our complete system by connecting a spectator and seeing what that client receives from the server. 

Then, we will test the complete product by connecting several player clients to our server and attempting to play the game on a variety of maps. We anticipate testing edge cases such too many players, spectators, and all players disconnecting. 

---

## Limitations

Our game does not allow two players with the same name to connect. It asks the 2nd player to input a new name and try again. 

For client to properly display its graphics it has to be run with stderr redirected away from the terminal.
